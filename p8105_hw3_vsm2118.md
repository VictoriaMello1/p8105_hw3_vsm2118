## Problem 1

#### Read in the data

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart |> 
  as_tibble()
```

#### Answer questions about the data

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns, with each row
resprenting a single product from an instacart order. Variables include
identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which each
product was added to the cart. There are several order-level variables,
describing the day and time of the order, and number of days since prior
order. Then there are several item-specific variables, describing the
product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs,
produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item
has been ordered by this user in the past. In total, there are 39123
products found in 131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.

Below is a table summarizing the number of items ordered from aisle. In
total, there are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits
holding the most items ordered by far.

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # ℹ 124 more rows

Next is a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle.
Here, aisles are ordered by ascending number of items.

``` r
instacart |> 
  count(aisle) |> 
  filter(n > 10000) |> 
  mutate(aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Number of items ordered in each aisle") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1))
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_vsm2118_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="90%" />

Our next table shows the three most popular items in aisles
`baking ingredients`, `dog food care`, and `packaged vegetables fruits`,
and includes the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart |> 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  count(product_name) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) |> 
  filter(rank < 4) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product_name                                  |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |

Finally is a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week. This
table has been formatted in an untidy manner for human readers. Pink
Lady Apples are generally purchased slightly earlier in the day than
Coffee Ice Cream, with the exception of day 5.

``` r
instacart |>
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) |>
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) |>
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow, 
    values_from = mean_hour) |>
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'product_name'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

| product_name     |     0 |     1 |     2 |     3 |     4 |     5 |     6 |
|:-----------------|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Coffee Ice Cream | 13.77 | 14.32 | 15.38 | 15.32 | 15.22 | 12.26 | 13.83 |
| Pink Lady Apples | 13.44 | 11.36 | 11.70 | 14.25 | 11.55 | 12.78 | 11.94 |

## Problem 2

##### Data Cleaning

``` r

States with 7 or more observations in 2010

In 2002 a total of 36 states were observed at 7 or more locations. The
states observed at the most locations in 2002 were PA with 40, followed
by MA and NJ both having 32. By 2010, the total number of states
observed at 7 or more locations increased to 45. The states observed at
the most locations in 2010 were FL with 164, followed by NJ with 76, and
TX with 64 locations.

##### Dataset limited to Excellent responses and a spaghetti plot:

``` r
excellent_avg <- brfss_data_cleaned %>%
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>%
  group_by(state, year) %>%
  summarize(avg_data_value = mean(data_value)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = avg_data_value, group = state, color = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = "Average Data Value Over Time (Excellent Responses) by State",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Average Data Value"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'state'. You can override using the
    ## `.groups` argument.

``` r
excellent_avg
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_vsm2118_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="90%" />
The plot provides a useful tool for visualizing and comparing trends in
the average data value of “Excellent” responses between states over
time. It allows for a comparison between states over the years 2002 to
2010. The average data value is represented by the y-axis and the range
of the graph on the y-axis is 10%-35%. Year is represented on the x-axis
with a range of 2002-2010. However, due to there being 50 states, the
plot is quite busy and it is challenging to distinguish between the
lines of individual states. One observation that can be made from the
plot is that most states appear to be following a similar fluctuating
trend for the average “Excellent” responses to the “Overall Health”
topic over time. However, without specific data points or a clearer
view, it’s difficult to make more detailed observations or conclusions.

##### Two-panel scatterplot showing the distribution of data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among locations in NY State in the years 2006 and 2010:

``` r
# Filter the dataset to include only NY State and the years 2006 and 2010
ny_data <- brfss_data_cleaned %>%
  filter(state == "NY" & year %in% c(2006, 2010) & response %in% c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Excellent"))

custom_colors <- c("NY - Bronx County" = "black", "NY - Erie County" = "blue", "NY - Kings County" = "green", "NY - Monroe County" = "purple", "NY - New York County" = "orange",
                   "NY - Nassau County" = "cyan", "NY - Queens County" = "brown", "NY - Suffolk County" = "yellow", "NY - Westchester County" = "pink")

# Create the scatter plot for 2006 and 2010 and facet by year
plot_combined <- ggplot(ny_data, aes(x = response, y = data_value, color = locationdesc)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.6, position = position_jitter(w = 0.2, h = 0)) +   
  scale_color_manual(values = custom_colors) +  # Use the custom color palette
  labs(title = "Distribution of Data Value by Location in New York State",
       x = "Response",
       y = "Data Value",
       color = "Location") +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_grid(year ~ .)

plot_combined
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_vsm2118_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="90%" />
As seen in the two panel scatterplot showing the distribution of
data_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among counties in NY
State for the years 2006 and 2010, the “Good” response option to the
question “How is your general health?” was the most common response,
followed by “Excellent”, “Fair”, and “Poor” in both years. Data from
2010 has information on a greater number of NY counties than the 2006
dataset does, including information for these additional counties:
Bronx, Erie, and Monroe counties. In 2006, the county with the highest
distribution of “Excellent” health was New York County, whereas in 2010
it was Westchester county. In 2006, the county with the highest
distribution of “Poor” health was also New York County, although in 2010
it was Kings county.

<img src="p8105_hw3_vsm2118_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-11-2.png" width="90%" />
The table illustrates the distribution of participants based on their
education level and gender. This table offers insights into the number
of participants in each education level, categorized by their gender.
For individuals with “less than high school” education, there are 27
male participants and 28 female participants. In the “high school
equivalent” education group, there are 35 male participants and 23
female participants. Among those with “more than high school” education,
there are 56 male participants and 59 female participants. Looking at
the plot of age distributions for men and women across education
categories, it appears that the age distribution for both men and women
in the “less than high school” category is wide, however, the
distribution for women appears to be slightly more skewed towards older
ages compared to men. In the “high school equivalent” category, the age
distribution for both genders is broad, but the peak for women seems to
be at a slightly older age than for men. Finally, in the “more than high
school” category, the peak for women is at a younger age compared to
men, indicating that women are more likely to complete higher education
at a younger age than men

##### Plot of total activity by age, sex, and education level:

``` r
activity_total =
  joined_data %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(
    total_activity = sum(c_across(min1:min1440)) %>% 
    as.numeric())
        
# Plot total activity by age, gender, and education level
total_activity_plot <- ggplot(activity_total, aes(x = age, y = total_activity)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = sex)) +
  facet_wrap(~education) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Total Activity by Age, Gender, and Education Level",
       x = "Age",
       y = "Total Activity",
       color = "Gender") +
  theme_minimal()

total_activity_plot
```

    ## `geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'

<img src="p8105_hw3_vsm2118_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="90%" />
Based on the scatter plot of total activity by age, sex, and education
level, it appears that total activity for both genders tends to decrease
with age across all education categories. Women tend to have higher
total activity than men in the younger age groups, especially in the
“less than high school” category. The “less than high school” category
shows higher total activity for both genders compared to the other
categories, especially for the younger age groups. Finally, the
steepness of the graph trendlines suggests that people with less
education tend to have less physical activity with increasing age.
Specifically, the “less than high school” category shows a steeper
decline in total activity with increasing age compared to the other
categories, indicating that people with less education may be more
susceptible to physical inactivity as they age

##### Three-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time courses for each education level and by sex:

``` r
# Reshape the data into long format
hourly_data <- joined_data %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("min"), names_to = "minute", values_to = "activity") %>%
  mutate(
    minute = as.numeric(gsub("min", "", minute)),  # Extract minute number
    hour = (minute - 1) %/% 60  # Calculate the hour
  ) %>%
  group_by(education, sex, hour) %>%
  summarize(mean_activity = mean(activity)) %>%
  ungroup()
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'education', 'sex'. You can override using
    ## the `.groups` argument.

``` r
# Create the three-panel plot
hourly_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = mean_activity, color = sex)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, size = 1) +  
  facet_wrap(~education, scales = "free") +
  labs(x = "Hour of the Day", y = "Mean Activity Level") +
  theme_minimal()

Based on the results of the three-panel plot showing the 24-hour
activity time courses for each education level by sex, it seems that
overall, males have higher mean activity levels than females at every
hour of the day. The only exception is for the “less than high school”
group where the female mean activity level trend line is higher than
that of males during the late afternoon and early evening hours.
Additionally, individuals with more than a high school education have
higher mean activity levels throughout the day compared to those with
lower levels of education. Generally, it seems that mean activity levels
are highest in the morning (around 8-10am) and gradually decrease
throughout the day, with the lowest levels around 8-10pm.
